# Visualizing-Earnings-Based-On-College-Majors
The aim of this project is to perform exploratory data visualization and analysis on college majors data.

In this project we'll be working with a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by American Community Survey which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their Github repo.
Each row in the dataset corresponds to a different major in college and contains information on employment rates, gender diversity, median salaries and etc. 

Using visualizations, we can begin to explore questions from the dataset such as:
Do students in more popular majors make more money? (Using scatter plots)
What's the most common median salary? (Using histograms)
Which category of majors have the most students? (Using bar plots)
